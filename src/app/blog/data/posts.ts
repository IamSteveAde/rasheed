      Try applying for a job today without a phone. Try running a business
      without mobile data. Try learning a new skill when your village has no
      internet connection.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      That’s digital poverty. And it’s more common than you think.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Digital poverty happens when people don’t have the tools, knowledge,
      or access to take part in an increasingly online world. It means you
      don’t have a working device, you can’t afford data, or no one ever
      showed you how to use these tools in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t just a personal problem. It’s a social one.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some, digital poverty means being unable to join online classes
      because the household owns just one phone. For others, it means
      walking long distances to borrow a device just to fill out a
      government form or apply for a grant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, it’s as simple and devastating as not knowing that an
      opportunity even existed, because it was shared online.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      This is the silent exclusion that’s growing wider every year.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      And it’s not just a rural problem. Even in cities, people are affected
      by poor network coverage, unaffordable data, or outdated devices.
      Young people with potential are locked out of opportunities.
      Women who could grow small businesses are limited by lack of access.
      Elderly people can’t get basic services or connect with their families.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- REALITY CHECK -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <p>
      Many people believe digital poverty can be fixed by handing out phones
      or laptops. That’s a start — but it’s not enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can give someone a smartphone. But what if they don’t know how to
      send an email, use Google Maps, or fill out a digital form?
      You can set up free Wi-Fi. But what if people are afraid to use it
      because they’ve been scammed before?
    </p>

    <p>
      Real digital inclusion means <strong>access plus training plus trust</strong>.
      Anything less is just a temporary fix.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT’S AT STAKE -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Let’s be honest: everything is going online. Government services,
      health records, business tools, education platforms, job boards,
      bank accounts, voter registration, and even social interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re offline, you’re not just missing out — you’re being left
      behind. You’re forced to rely on others. You’re less able to protect
      yourself, earn a living, or plan for the future.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHO IS AFFECTED -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Who Is Most Affected</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Women and girls, especially where men are prioritised for devices</li>
      <li>People in rural communities with weak or non-existent networks</li>
      <li>Young people from low-income households</li>
      <li>Seniors who were never introduced to digital tools</li>
      <li>People with disabilities excluded by poor design and training</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If we don’t act now, access to the internet becomes the new dividing
      line between the empowered and the powerless.

  <div class="article-action">
    <h3>What Can Be Done</h3>

      "Gender inequality isn’t just about education or leadership. Access to technology remains one of the biggest barriers.",

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <div class="article-intro">
    <p class="lede">
      Gender inequality isn’t just about how many women are in school or how many
      men are in power.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      It’s about control — over time, income, choices, and opportunity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      In many parts of the world, including Nigeria, that control is still limited.
      The gender gap shows up everywhere — in pay, land ownership, leadership,
      and representation in public office.
    </p>

    <p>
      Women are more likely to carry the burden of unpaid care work: cooking,
      cleaning, and looking after children, often without support or recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>2024 Global Gender Gap Report</strong>, full equality
      is still more than a century away. That means girls born today may grow up
      facing the same barriers their mothers and grandmothers did.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DATA POINT -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <blockquote>
      In Nigeria, women make up nearly half the population,
      yet hold less than 20% of senior roles across government and business.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That’s not just unfair — it’s a waste of talent. When women are excluded,
      families, businesses, and entire economies miss out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countries with higher gender equality consistently show stronger economies,
      healthier children, and more stable communities.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DIGITAL GAP -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      One of the fastest-growing inequalities today is the <strong>digital gender gap</strong>.
      As jobs, services, and opportunities move online, women without access to
      phones, data, or basic digital skills are left behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Nigeria, women are far less likely than men to own smartphones or use the
      internet regularly. This limits access to jobs, business tools, financial
      services, and even critical health and safety information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SOLUTIONS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>How Do We Bridge the Gap?</h3>

    <p>
      Closing the gender gap starts with intentional investment in three areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Education and skills training</strong> — not just schooling, but
        relevant skills such as digital literacy, finance, leadership, and negotiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fair policies and enforcement</strong> — laws must work in practice,
        not just exist on paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access to tools and capital</strong> — smartphones, data,
        business funding, and safe mobility.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- CLOSING -->
  <div class="article-action">
    <p class="closing">
      Bridging the gender gap won’t happen overnight — but it also won’t happen by
      accident.
    </p>

    <p>
      It requires action from governments, communities, employers, and individuals
      to remove the barriers that keep women stuck.
    </p>

    <p class="final">
      The goal is not to help women “catch up.”
      It’s to build a world where gender is no longer a barrier to success.

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Our Trustee, <strong>Linda Rogers</strong>, joined <strong>Tech Hub</strong>
      with <strong>Kenneth Akan</strong> on <strong>Silverbird TV</strong> to unpack
      one of Nigeria’s most pressing challenges: bridging the digital divide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conversation highlighted how access to technology, connectivity,
      and practical digital skills continues to shape who can participate
      meaningfully in today’s economy — and who is left behind.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

    <p>
      In a world where information is power, millions of Nigerians — particularly
      those in rural and low-income communities — still lack reliable internet,
      functional devices, and the skills needed to use them effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gap locks people out of online education, financial services,
      healthcare access, and participation in the wider digital economy.

  <!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Key Takeaways from the Conversation</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>What is Digital Inclusion?</strong> — Why putting a connected device
        in every hand, paired with affordable data and practical training,
        is essential for equity and empowerment.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>The Reality on the Ground</strong> — From markets to remote schools,
        the divide persists along lines of geography, gender, and income.

      <li>
        <strong>Shared Responsibility</strong> — The critical roles of government,
        telcos, NGOs, and communities in creating affordable and sustainable solutions.
